# VersionRoulette
Version roulette is a minecraft speedrunning challenge made purely for fun. The challenge consists of playing 5 different random versions of minecraft. 

This program makes it a little easier to get the randomised sequence of versions, as with every click of the "Spin the roulette!" button, 5 new versions are rolled and an image named "versions.png", which 
works as an updating OBS overlay is created. Unfortunately, I don't know how to create a new LiveSplit layout using python, but [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DKFK0kFOKAUD3sGnGBwoogYfgJHUelh/view?usp=sharing) is a very simple default one.

Rules:
- resetting is allowed
- the run is timed with RTA
- normal rules from SRC apply


PS. Don't spin the roulette just to get a better sequence of versions! Have fun! :D
