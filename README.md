# VersionRoulette
Version roulette is a minecraft speedrunning challenge made purely for fun. The challenge consists of playing 5 different random versions of minecraft. 

This program makes it a little easier to get the randomised sequence of versions, as with every click of the "Spin the roulette!" button, 5 new versions are rolled and an image named "versions.png", which 
works as an updating OBS overlay is created. Unfortunately, I don't know how to create a new LiveSplit layout using python, but here is a very simple default one - [splits]([https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/4t3kdu6807ni8yu1hy6h1/version_roulette_splits.lss](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4t3kdu6807ni8yu1hy6h1/version_roulette_splits.lss?rlkey=tsa9qirmer72iy8to23cu81ge&dl=0)).

Rules:
- resetting is allowed
- the run is timed with RTA
- normal rules from SRC apply


PS. spinning the roulette just to get a better sequence of versions makes you a coward. Have fun! :D
